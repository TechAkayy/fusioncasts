[Fusion](https://github.com/fusion-php/fusion) is the best way to combine your Laravel backend with your JavaScript frontend. We currently only support Vue.js,
but React + Svelte are on the roadmap.

This is a very small example app that shows off a few of Fusion's capabilities. It is a work in progress that will be updated over time.

Please refer to the [main Fusion repository](https://github.com/fusion-php/fusion) for documentation.
